INTRODUCTION                                    *scratchy*

Scratchy right now focuses on jq. There are three windows used in scratcy. The
output, input and the filter window. As you write a filter it autoupdates the
output window with the new json.

COMMANDS                                        *scratchy-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers/tab in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *scratchy-:ScratchyRun*
:ScratchyRun            Run an arbitrary git command. Similar to :!git [args]
                        but chdir to the repository tree first.
